---

**Living in Greece?**

**Love your music loud but hate getting *that knock* from the neighbours (or worse, the police üëÆ)?**

Fear no more! **Silence Hero** is the simple Chrome extension designed to save your speakers... and your sanity! It's your personal sidekick, keeping track of the official Greek quiet hours (**Police Order 3 of 1996**) so you don't have to constantly check the clock.

**Who is this for?**

* Anyone living in Greece (students, apartment dwellers, families, night owls!)
* Music lovers who sometimes forget the time
* People who host occasional gatherings
* Basically, anyone who wants to enjoy their sound without accidentally becoming *that* neighbour!

Silence Hero gives you a clear heads-up with visual cues and a countdown timer, letting you know exactly when it's time to turn it down (or crank it back up!).

## ‚ú® Features (aka Superpowers!)

* **Dynamic Icon (üü¢ / üî¥):** The extension icon is your instant status check! It automatically switches between **green** (Go Loud!) and a **soft red** (Shhh... Quiet Hours) based on the current time.
* **Helpful Popup:** Click the icon for the intel:
    * **Current status:** Clearly states `Quiet Hours` or `Non-Quiet Hours`.
    * **Countdown Timer:** Shows exactly how much time is left until the next status change. No more guesswork!
* **Automatic Dark Mode:** Like a true hero working in the shadows, the popup automatically switches to a **dark theme** between 8 PM and 6 AM for comfortable night viewing. Your eyes will thank you.
* **Smart Time Logic:** Knows the difference! Accurately follows the official quiet hours and automatically adjusts for the summer/winter periods:
    * **Summer (Apr 1 - Sep 30):** 15:00‚Äì17:30 & 23:00‚Äì07:00
    * **Winter (Oct 1 - Mar 31):** 15:30‚Äì17:30 & 22:00‚Äì07:30
* **Modern Design:** A clean, easy-to-read interface using the Comfortaa font, smooth rounded corners, and slick light/dark themes inspired by Chrome's own UI.
