![Silence Hero Banner](banner.png)

---

**Living in Greece?**

**Love your music loud but hate getting *that knock* from the neighbours (or worse, the police 👮)?**

Fear no more! **Silence Hero** is the simple Chrome/Edge extension designed to save your speakers... and your sanity! It's your personal sidekick, keeping track of the official Greek quiet hours (**[Police Order 3 of 1996](https://www.astynomia.gr/odigos-tou-politi/chrisimes-symvoules/diafores/poies-einai-oi-ores-koinis-isychias/)**) so you don't have to constantly check the clock.

**Who is this for?**

* Anyone living in Greece (students, apartment dwellers, families, night owls!)
* Music lovers who sometimes forget the time
* People who host occasional gatherings
* Basically, anyone who wants to enjoy their sound without accidentally becoming *that* neighbour!

Silence Hero gives you a clear heads-up with visual cues and a countdown timer, letting you know exactly when it's time to turn it down (or crank it back up!).

## ✨ Features (aka Superpowers!)

* **Dynamic Icon (🟢 / 🔴):** The extension icon is your instant status check! It automatically switches between **green** (Go Loud!) and a **soft red** (Shhh... Quiet Hours) with a pulsing animation to keep you alert.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A stunning, modern interface featuring frosted glass effects, clean **Inter** typography, and smooth animations. It looks as good as your music sounds!
* **Global Hero (i18n):** Automatically speaks your language! Fully localized for **English** and **Greek** based on your browser settings.
* **Customizable Settings:** Control your experience via the new Settings page:
    *   Toggle **Notifications** for status changes.
    *   Enable subtle **Sound Alerts**.

    *   **Auto Dark Mode:** Automatically switches theme based on time (8 PM - 6 AM).
* **Smart Time Logic:** Knows the difference! Accurately follows the official quiet hours and automatically adjusts for the summer/winter periods:
    * **Summer (Apr 1 - Sep 30):** 15:00–17:30 & 23:00–07:00
    * **Winter (Oct 1 - Mar 31):** 15:30–17:30 & 22:00–07:30
